Superstore Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing and enriching a Superstore dataset using PySpark on Databricks. The analysis includes merging multiple datasets, performing descriptive and diagnostic analytics, and preparing the data for potential predictive insights.



Project Overview

Datasets Used:
1. superstore_orders.csv: Contains details about customer orders, including sales, profit, and shipping information.
2. superstore_returns.csv: Contains information about returned orders.
3. superstore_people.csv: Contains regional manager information mapped by region.

 Objectives:
1. Join datasets to enrich the `superstore_orders` dataset with return information and regional manager details.
2. Perform detailed analyses, including:
   - Sales and profit trends.
   - Return rate by region, category, and product.
   - Performance evaluation of regional managers.
3. Prepare the enriched dataset for further predictive analytics.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites:
1. Databricks Workspace: Ensure you have access to a Databricks workspace.
2. Python 3.x: The project uses PySpark, compatible with Python 3.x.
3. Required Libraries:
   - PySpark
   - Pandas (optional for local testing)

 Steps to Run:
   
1. Upload the project files to your Databricks workspace.
2. Import the data files into Databricks:
   - `superstore_orders.csv`
   - `superstore_returns.csv`
   - `superstore_people.csv`
3. Run the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to execute the analysis pipeline.



 Key Analyses

 Data Enrichment
- Join Operations:
  - Joined `superstore_orders` with `superstore_returns` on `Order ID` to add return information.
  - Enriched the dataset with regional manager details by mapping `Region` from `superstore_people`.

 Descriptive Analysis
- Total Sales and Profit metrics.
- Breakdown of sales by region, category, and shipping mode.

 Diagnostic Analysis
- Impact of returns on profitability.
- Evaluation of regional manager performance.
- Return rate by region and category.

 Predictive Insights (Optional):
- Predicting return likelihood based on sales, discount, and category.
- Sales forecasting using historical trends.



 Results and Outputs

1. Enriched Dataset:
   - A cleaned and enriched version of the dataset, saved in CSV/Parquet format.
2. Reports and Visualizations:
   - Regional performance.
   - Return rate analysis.
   - Sales and profit trends.
